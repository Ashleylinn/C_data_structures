   * The image is in grayscale (black and white), so the colours are numbers 
   * from [0-255] where 0 is black, 255 is white, and the values in between 
   * are varying levels of gray.
   * 
   * You need to understand how the (x,y) values are stored so you know how 
   * they should be updated when you move (down means y increases, etc). You do 
   * not need to use the 'im' variable for anything other than passing it into 
   * the drawLine() function described below.
   * 
   * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 
   * Here's the setup - There is a turtle (with a pen) that walks along the 
   * image. When the pen is down (on the paper), it draws a line along the path 
   * that it walks on. (If you want to play around with this, consider looking 
   * at the `turtle` library in python!)
   * 
   * The turtle initially starts at pixel (0, 0) [at the top left], 
   * facing right (in the positive x direction). The pen starts off
   * as `down`, with the default colour being black (0).
   * 
   * You need to go through the linked list and 'run' the commands to keep 
   * track of the turtles position, and draw the appropriate lines. Here is 
   * what each command should do:
   * 
   *  - penup          : Put the pen up (stop drawing)
   *  - pendown        : Put the pen down (start / continue drawing)
   *  - colour <val>   : Draw lines in colour <val> from now on
   *  - forward <val>  : Move the turtle forward <val> steps (pixels) 
   *                     in the direction it is facing.
   *  - backward <val> : Same as above, except move backwards
   *  - right          : Turn the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
   *  - left           : Turn the turtle to the left by 90 degrees
   * 
   * NOTE: Make sure that you do *not* go outside the image. For this, set the 
   * maximum and minimum values of x and y to be 0 and SIZEX-1 / SIZEY-1 
   * respectively.
   * 
   * For instance, if the turtle is at (0,0) facing right, and your command is
   * `forward 100000`, it will only go forward till (SIZEX-1, 0), and end 
   * up at the rightmost pixel in that row.
   * 
   * IMPORTANT: Once you are done with all the commands, make sure you save the 
   * final (x,y) location of the turtle into the variables endX and endY.
   * 
   * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * 
   * We have already implemented a drawLine() function (in imgUtils.c) which 
   * you should use to actually draw the lines. It takes in the following:
   * 
   *      - a pointer to an image struct (use 'im')
   *      - (x,y) location of start point
   *      - (x,y) location of end point
   *      - a colour to draw the line in [0-255]
   *          
   * Note that this function only draws horizontal and vertical lines, so 
   * either the x values or the y values of both points must be the same. 
   * Both these points *must* also be within the image. 
   *          [ 0 <= x < SIZEX,  0 <= y < SIZEY ]
